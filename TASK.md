Flickr Test, Yahoo7

Instructions:
Design and implement a solution to the following task, with the following requirements in mind:
 • Your solution should be clear, efficient and maintainable.

 • Your solution should demonstrate your object oriented programming skills.
   For example: you should be able to manage dependencies well and ensure separation of responsibilities.

 • Your solution must not use any external libraries or frameworks that are not part of the
   standard language libraries (eg. jquery, bootstrap, smarty, cakePHP, Symfony, composer packages etc.).
   The only exception from this rule is that you are allowed to use a unit testing framework of your choice,
   if you decided to write unit tests for your code (eg. your tests classes can use PHPUnit code).

 • You are free to use whatever resources or references that are available to you, but it is
   expected that the design/solution will be 100% your own.

 • Your solution should be in the form of a plain-text file or files, in a compressed file format (tar.gz, zip, rar, tar).
   You should take no more than 24 hours to complete your work. But don't rush it -- no extra marks for getting it done quickly!

Task:
Create a Flickr image gallery, using PHP and HTML. The user should be able to enter a keyword, which is then
used to search Flickr. The search results should be paginated and displayed as five results per page,
and the user should be able to navigate to other pages. Each image should be displayed as a thumbnail;
clicking on the thumbnail should open a new page which shows the full-size image. Keep in mind that your solution
should work efficiently, no matter how many images match the keyword.

Remember: this is an opportunity for you to showcase your skills and knowledge of good programming practices and methodologies.
